		<h2>All About Less Media, More Social</h2>
		<p>We are a group of individuals who miss the times of a healthy discussion. We host events in multiple locations and build our community. We want to urge others to take a step back, and enjoy the moment they are in. Set aside your social media for the night and join us for a night of fun!</p>
		
		<p>The events includes a three course meal catered by out partner Rooted Delights. They focus on vegan delicious eats. After and during your meal, you will hear from different typed of entertertainment- smooth soul singers; instrumental, and spoken word. When you arrive at the event we urge people to lock up their phone for hours or so and unplug. We have our host lock phones in a secure location. Locking your phone up for the night, enters you in a raffle and a chance to win some prizes! After your three course meal, we encourage people to stay an have some real talk discussions with no judgements. We are all apart of a community your voice is important. We will have topics, but feel to pick your own topic of discussion and debate.</p> 

		<p>We also discuss how we can better ourselves and our community; the more the merrier!</p>
